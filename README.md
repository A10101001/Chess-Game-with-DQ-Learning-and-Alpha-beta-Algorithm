# Chess-Game-with-DQ-Learning-and-Alpha-beta-Algorithm
Program to play Chess against DQ Learning and the Alpha-Beta algorithm. In the Menu, you can select to train the model, play against DQ Learning, or play against the Alpha-Beta algorithm and DQ Learning together. Once the model is trained, the learned configuration is saved in an external file. This configuration can be reset from the Menu. Training can be done against itself or Stockfish; in both cases, use DQ Learning to play. If you choose to train, you have to enter the number of plays or iterations. I always recommend training against Stockfish because it is much faster.

In the "assets" folder, you will find the images of the chess pieces.

You should have downloaded Stockfish in the same folder that contains your project.
